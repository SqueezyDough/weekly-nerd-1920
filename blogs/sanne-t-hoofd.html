      Sanne 't Hoofd is an UX designer and teacher at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (AUAS). This week he told us about microtransactions and the power of pure CSS. Sanne gives lectures to students from the propaedeutic year exclusively. Here students can assign to a course where he learns them to experiment and discover CSS.

        <h3>How I've come to know Sanne</h3>
        <p>
            During my propaedeutic year I've also had the privilege to get some lectures from him. What I noticed that lots of people spoke negative about him. I've personally know him as an excellent lecturer who can get feedback about the tinyest of detail, and every piece of criticism is backed up by sound arguments. 
            I learned a lot from this criticism and I was therefore excited to get a new lecture from Sanne almost 2 years after our last sparring session.

            <h3>Micro interactions</h3>
            <p>
                Sanne told us a bit about micro interactions. This was something he had told us before, but it was nice to have a refresh. He told us that the first thing you need to do is to understand what the user needs at a given time/page on your website. A micro interaction is something that makes the 
                experience more pleasurable. If you manage to understand you users needs and create appropriate micro interations to accommodate to those needs, it's likely you;ll create a positive association to your product.
            </p>

            <h4>Defining micro transactions</h4>
            <p>
                He showed us a diagram from Dan schaffer. According to Dan schaffer a micro interaction is definined as following:

                <ul>
                    <li>A signiture moment in a digital product</li>
                    <li>A product based around one micro interaction</li>
                    <li>People see interaction with a digital product as a series as micro interactions</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
