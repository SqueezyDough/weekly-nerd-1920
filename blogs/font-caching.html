        Web fonts cache
        Another idea I had is to cache web fonts. As with images, loading web fonts can be a heavy task, since they have to load seperately. Caching them makes sense because fonts aren't updated frequently.

        I've cached fonts the same way I do with other file types. As you could've seen above, I look for different file types, including fonts

        function isCachedFileType(fileType) {
            return ['image', 'font', 'script', 'manifest'].includes(fileType)
        }
        What others are saying about caching fonts
        Other sources confirm the importance of storing webfonts as well.

        Sources about the importance of caching webfonts
        Proper caching is a must If your web application uses a service worker, serving font resources with a cache-first strategy is appropriate for most use cases. You should not | store fonts using localStorage or IndexedDB; each of those has its own set of performance issues. - Source: developers.google.com

        Since fonts are static resources that aren’t frequently updated, they can be cached locally in the browser, saving users having to download your fonts again the next time they access your site. This way, the amount of data the user’s browser has to download, as well as the number of HTTP requests, are reduced.

        Google’s Web Fundamentals guide recommends making sure your servers provide a long-lived max-age timestamp and a revalidation token to allow for efficient font reuse between different pages on your site. - Source: WP Rocket

        Each font carries a weight that the web browser needs to download before they can be displayed. With the correct setup, the additional load time isn’t noticeable. However, get it wrong and your users could be waiting up to a few seconds before any text is displayed. - Source: Smashing Magazine

        Licenses
        But is it allowed to cache fonts on your user's computer? It's hard to give a definite answer, since font licenses might vary per distributor / creator, but here's a quick overview.

        Distributor	Personal or non-commercial use	Commercial use
        Google fonts (Open source)	allowed	allowed
        Microsoft	not allowed	not allowed
        Dafont.com	varies	varies

        Caching
        Google fonts are already cached if you use a link instead of downloading it for a whole year. This also means if you visit a page which also uses a cached font, it doesn't need to download again.

        Source: Smashing magazine

        If you choose to self-host a font this is also allowed by Google, but again other distributors might handle this differently. From my research it's hard to find caching mentioned explicitly in most EULA's. House Industries is mentioning it however:

        The Licensed Software may not be copied or duplicated in any form except for storage or caching as may temporarily occur during proper use of the Licensed Software, and, optionally, a single copy solely for backup purposes. The Licensed Software and its related documentation may not be resold, rented, leased, sublicensed or lent to another person or entity.

        Microsoft is only mentioning the restriction of redistribution. Since caching can be viewed as redistribution / copying it can be assumed that caching is not allowed, but further clarifications by Microsoft and other distributers might be necessary.

        Conclusion
        When caching fonts the general rules for using fonts still apply. The font should either be free for personal / commercial use or you have to pay a license fee. Caching fonts is the same as redistribution / copying fonts on other computers. If the license doesn't mention explicitly that caching is excluded from that rule, the distribution restriction should be followed, and therefore fonts should NOT be cached without risking a fine.

        Google Fonts is allowing caching for all their free fonts however and many web articles verify the importance of caching webfonts to improve the overall performance of your webapp. So if you want to play it safe, use Google fonts.
