      <h2>Learning react.js</h2>
    </div>
    
    <p>
      I need to tell you something. Next year I will start as a frontend developer intern at INFO. 
      During my interview I said I knew they were using the React.js framework and this is something I wanted to learn before my first day there.
      I didn't just write the last article about web components just because I was interested in the technology. At CMD we always learn to first
      understand the technology or paradigm that lies as the foundation for a framework or library, before we use the library or framework itself. 
      This is why I chose to do web components first, and now I will take it a step further to achieve my goal of learning a frontend framework like react.

        <h3>What is react.js?</h3>
        <p>
          React is a frontent framework for building user interfaces. Just like with web components, with react you can
          create modular building blocks that are completely autonomous. The good thing about react is that the state
          of a component can change without page reload.
        </p>
       
        <h4>Declaritive</h4>
        <p>
          With React it is easy to manage the state of your component. Components update and rerender themselves when the data
          of your component changes. This means no page reload is required when the data is updated. 
        </p> 
        
        <h4>Component Based</h4>
        <p>
          Just like in web components, Reacts components are also fully encapsulated that can manage their own state. This makes it easy 
          to compose these components on a web page without having to worry about code collision. 
        </p> 

        <h4>JSX</h4>
        <p>
          In react everything you build is a component. The interesting thing about React is that components can also have subcomponents
          , which are components that can be used as its own component or can be nested inside another component. This makes React
          really flexible. JSX is Reacts own version of HTML that allow uou to nest these custom HTML elements.
        </p>

        <h4>Differences between states and props</h4>
        <p>
          A component in React can both have states and props. The differences between these could be a bit vague at first, as it was also 
          vague for me the first time. The most important difference is that props are handled outside of the component and also must be
          updated outside the component, while states are handled inside the component and must therefore be handled
          inside the component.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another important difference is that any change to a state will rerender that section of your application. Props
          can't be changed by State and therefore must be updated outside of the component. It could be that the prop is
          managed by another State outside of the inner component. When that state changes it will change the props given to the inner component 
          and rerender itself. This is very important to understand when you are trying to manage your data using components and 
          subcomponents.
        </p>

        <h3>Creating a Todo list with React</h3>
        <p>
          I have worked on a small project where you can create a todo list that shows the basic functionality of React. You can do much more things with React, for to keep this
          article concise I've mainly focussed on the basics. In this article I'll highlight some code from that project to provide some 
        </p>

        <h4>Setting up</h4>
        <p>
          To create a react application to first need an empty folder that has no capital letters of spaces in its name.
          You can then run the following command in your terminal:

          <pre>
            <code>
  npx create-react-app .
            </code>
          </pre>

          This will install react into your folder. It should take a few minutes to get everything ready. Once all the
          files are installed you get a basic application structure for your app. I have deleted all the standard markup
          and added files for my todo list.

          <img class="small" src="../images/folder.png" alt="folder structure">

          To run the application you can use

          <pre>
            <code>
npm start
            </code>
          </pre>
        </p>

        <h4>Rendering the appv</h4>
        <p>
          When looking at the index.html file you see that there only is an empty div element.

          <pre>
            <code>
&lt;div id="root"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            </code>
          </pre>

          When we look at the index.js file in the src folder we see that this empty div is used to render the application.

          <pre>
            <code>
ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;React.StrictMode&gt;
    &lt;App /&gt;
  &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt;,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
            </code>
          </pre>

          ReactDOM.render() takes two arguments. The first argument takes the App component we want to render and the second take
          the element that serves as a target container for the content.
        </p>
      </section>

      <h4>Adding markup</h4> 
      <p>
        In the App.js component I can now add markup for my Todos. The problem is that I need to return both the Todo list and 
        the buttons to create or clear completed todos. As you know a return only can return a single value. In React you
        can use Fragments to wrap different HTML elements together so they can be returned as a single value.
        
        <pre>
          <code>
return (
  &lt;&gt;
    &lt;TodoList todos={todos} toggleTodo={toggleTodo} /&gt;
    &lt;input ref={todoNameRef} type="text" /&gt;
    &lt;button onClick={handleAddTodo}&gt;Add Todo&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;button onClick={handleClearTodos}&gt;Clear completed todos&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;{todos.filter(todo =&gt; !todo.complete).length} left to do&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/&gt;
)
          </code>
        </pre>

        You already see some props en events in this markup, however to keep things simple I only focus on the TodoList for now.
      </p>

      <h4>Managing the state</h4>
      <p>
        I can manage the state of my component to react on user interaction. For my Todo list that is when the user sets
        a todo as completed using a checkbox. To enable this I can use the useState hook from React to rerender the 
        component every time the data changes.

        <pre>
          <code>
const [todos, setTodos] = useState([])

...

&lt;TodoList todos={todos} toggleTodo={toggleTodo} /&gt;
          </code>
        </pre>

        The useState hook always returns an arrays. We can use destructering where the first variable has all of our todos
        and the second variable is a function that update the todos. We can add the todos from our state as a prop to our Todolist component.
      </p>

      <h4>The TodoList component</h4>
      <p>
        The Todolist component is al list that has all of our todos.
        In this component we can now use the prop to map over all our todos and render a todo that is also a seperate component.
        When using map() to render new components you need to be careful however, because when a component gets updated React doesn't 
        know which component to update because it can't destinguish them from each other. To fix this you can add a key attribute
        to the component that has a unique Id.

        <pre>
          <code>
import Todo from './Todo'

export default function TodoList({ todos, toggleTodo }) {
  return (
    todos.map(todo => {
      return &lt;Todo key={todo.id} toggleTodo={toggleTodo} todo={todo} /&gt;
    })
  )
}
          </code>
        </pre>

        In our Todo component we add 2 new props that give a name of the todo and we want to give it a value
        that tells our Todo component whether its checkbox is checked or not.
      </p>

      <h4>The Todo component</h4>
      <p>
        The last component is our Todo component itself that has the todo name and complete checkbox.

        <pre>
          <code>
export default function Todo({ todo, toggleTodo }) {
  function handleTodoClick() {
    toggleTodo(todo.id)
  }

  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;label&gt;
        &lt;input type="checkbox" checked={todo.complete} onChange={handleTodoClick} /&gt;
        {todo.name}
      &lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  )
}
          </code>
        </pre>

        Besides the name and the complete value we also want to handle a click event for when the user clicks the checkbox.
        We'll have to write a different event for this, so in out Todo component I have made a handleTodoClick function that calls
        another function we've got from the TodoList component as a prop.
      </p>

      <h4>Handling events</h4>
      <p>
        We've passed the toggleTodo function as a prop all the way from our App component. Here we can create the function to
        toggle completed todos.

        <pre>
          <code>
// set todo complete to opposite value
function toggleTodo(id) {
  const newTodos = [...todos]
  const todo = newTodos.find(todo => todo.id === id)
  todo.complete = !todo.complete
  setTodos(newTodos)
}
          </code>
        </pre>

        This function takes the todo Id as an argument and sets the complete property to the opposite value.
      </p>

      <p>
        In our HTML amrkup I also added a create Todo button. This also has a click event to create new todos. Lets make that 
        function now as well.

        <pre>
          <code>
// handle add todo button
function handleAddTodo(e) {
  const name = todoNameRef.current.value
  if (name === '') return
  setTodos(prevTodos => {
    return [...prevTodos, {id: uuidv4(), name: name, complete: false}]
  })
  todoNameRef.current.value = null
}
          </code>
        </pre>
        This function takes the value from the text input to create a new todo. Notice that I reference the text input using 
        ref={todoNameRef}. In react it is possibe to add references to other elements, so it can be used by my function.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this function I also use the setTodos function from my state to create new todos. Here I use prevTodos as argument 
        for all my previous todos and I add a new todo to the array with an unique uuid.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Persistant data</h4>
      <p>
        Now we can both add todos and complete them using the checkbox. When the user clicks on the checkbox the Todo component
        automatically updates. 
        <img class="small" src="../images/todo.png" alt="todos">
        
        
        The problem here is that if we reload our page the todos do not persist. 
        <img class="small" src="../images/clear.png" alt="todos">

        To fix this we can use localStorage to save the todos so the component loads the data. We also need
        to use a new React hook that excecutes every time the component is rerendered. This hook is called
        useEffect().
        
        <pre>
          <code>
// get stored todos
useEffect(() => {
  const storedTodos = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(LOCAL_STOARGE_KEY))
  if (storedTodos) setTodos(storedTodos)
}, [])

// save todos to local storage every time the array changes
useEffect(() => {
  localStorage.setItem(LOCAL_STOARGE_KEY, JSON.stringify(todos))
}, [todos])
          </code>
        </pre>

        The first useEffect function gets all the todos from local storage. The second excecutes whenever the data changes.
        Whats important here is that useEffect takes a function and a value as a second argument. Whenever that value changes the function
        will be called and the component will be rerendered. For getting data we only want to to this once. We can do this by just 
        giving it an empty array. Because that array will never change the function will only run once.
      </p>

      <p>
        With that our TodoList will now also be persitant and our React app is compeltely finished.
      </p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        I really REALLY like React. I've always liked to make my back-end as modular as I can, but on the front-end there was always some modularity
        (I've always used SCSS and handlebars) but not much.
        I couldn't really create nice autonomous components that can manage their own stuff and making it refresh without page reload was always a pain in the ass. 
        Now I finally got the basics of React I want to keep
        using this for a while to create some nice readable, flexible and maintanable code, without having to strip large parts of my frontend logic when I 
        want to make some changes. Luckily I'll have time enough for that during my internship at INFO.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've used the Weekly Nerds to fill some gaps from the minor. The things I have researched were things I didn't get to learn during the 
        minor. I knew this beforehand ofcourse, and this part of the minor gives you some extra free space to research whatever you think is
        important for this moment or next year.
